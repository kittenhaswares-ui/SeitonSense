# Third-party notices

## Final Fantasy XIV duty artwork

Crystalline Conflict duty-art textures are owned by Square Enix. Seiton Sense
does not copy or redistribute them; the rotation panel requests the reviewed
icons at runtime from the user's installed game files through Dalamud's texture
service.

## PvP Tracker interoperability research

The Crystalline Conflict result-packet layout and the current match-end hook
signature were researched and cross-checked against:

- PvP Tracker / PvpStats by SaMo (`wrath16/PvpStats`)
- Source: https://github.com/wrath16/PvpStats
- License: MIT

No PvP Tracker UI, database, timeline, action parser, or live-combat code is
included. Seiton Sense uses a small, independently structured interoperability
boundary containing only the numeric offsets needed to confirm a local
post-match result.
